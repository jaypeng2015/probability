## Course Description
This course introduces students to the modeling, quantification, and analysis of uncertainty.  The tools of probability theory, and of the related field of statistical inference, are the keys for being able to analyze and make sense of data. These tools underlie important advances in many fields, from the basic sciences to engineering and management.
